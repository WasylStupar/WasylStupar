                <p>An internal combustion engine is a type of heat engine in which the fuel mixture is burned directly in the working chamber (inside) 
                    of the engine.  Combustion products form the working body.  Such an engine is primary, chemical, and converts the energy of fuel 
                    combustion into mechanical work.
